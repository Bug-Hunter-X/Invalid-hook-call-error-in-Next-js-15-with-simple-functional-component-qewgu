```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Home</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent; 
```
The solution involves carefully reviewing all imported packages and making sure that no unexpected hook calls are made either directly or indirectly by third-party libraries.  In this particular case there is no solution as the code presented is correct. The problem seems to be a bug within Next.js itself.
